## Rules & Objectives

- Try to reveal all non-bomb squares on a grid while flagging all squares that have bombs!
- Numbered squares indicate the number of bombs in the surrounding squares.
- Be careful not to trigger the bomb launching poor Kirby super far away!
- Left-clicking a square reveals the square, right-clicking toggles a flag on or off on a square.
- Retry button and difficulty buttons reset to a new game
- Victory or Defeat will be announced in the upper right corner and kirby's animation will change.

- Notes: Game automatically ends when bomb is revealed, or victory is achieved, and squares become unclickable
- Also, you cannot left click a flagged square, you must unflag it first
- The dev button is there if you want to cheat or test the code. It reveals where mines are in orange behind the grass.

### Technologies Used and Dependencies

- Files including: "index.html", "minesweeper_script.js", and "minesweeper_style.css"
