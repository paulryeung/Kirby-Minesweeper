# Title

Kirby and the Tasty Minefields

## Description

Kirby is hungry, can and will eat anything. He's also indestructable,
making him perfect for minesweeping duties. This is a Kirby themed game of Minesweeper.
Comes in 3 difficulties of different grid sizes and bomb amounts

- Try to reveal all non-bomb squares on a grid while flagging all squares that have bombs!
- Numbered squares indicate the number of bombs in the surrounding squares.
- Be careful not to trigger the bomb launching poor Kirby super far away!
- Left-clicking a square reveals the square, right-clicking toggles a flag on or off on a square.
