Kirby and the Tasty Minefields

Kirby is hungry, can and will eat anything. He's also indestructable,
making him perfect for minesweeping duties. This is a Kirby themed game of Minesweeper.
Comes in 3 difficulties of different grid sizes and bomb amounts

- Try to reveal all non-bomb squares on a grid while flagging all squares that have bombs!
- Numbered squares indicate the number of bombs in the surrounding squares.
